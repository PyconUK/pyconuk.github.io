<h3 id="lightningtalks"></a>The Lightning Talk Show</h3>
<p>Lightning Talks are speeches limited to 5
minutes, covering any topic.</p>

<p>The Lightning Talk Man orchestrates the proceedings. He
ensures that timing is kept and links the talks with his own
stories. That way he keeps the audience attentive, forms the
aesthetics and promotes the speakers.</p>

<p>From Stuttgart, Germany, Harald Armin Massa has been the MC of
the PyCon UK lightning talks since PyCon UK hosted Europython
in 2009 and 2010 and we decided we like him so much that we
had to keep him.</p>

<h3 id="panel">The PyCon UK Panel</h3>

<p>In the style of Question Time (or Gardeners' Question Time,
but without the plants), PyCon UK's acting Chair Zeth chairs a
panel of five Python experts who try to answer your questions
about the future of Python, Software development and the
meaning of life, the universe and everything.</p>
<p>The PyCon UK panel often includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Michael Foord: Python core developer and Go
  programmer. Works for Canonical, knows more than is healthy
    about Python testing and Cloud computing.</li>
  <li>Sarah Mount: Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the
  University of Wolverhampton. Loves to talk about distributed
    Python and concurrency.</li>
  <li>Van Lindberg is a smiley chap and Vice President of
  Intellectual Property at Rackspace and chairman of the
  PSF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Python for Science</h2>

<p>If you are a working scientist then this track is for you --
  whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in
  the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista, looking to expand
  your repertoire. The PyConUK Science Track will offer you three days
  of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other
  scientists using Python.</p>

<p>The PyConUK Science Track will feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tutorials on Python suitable for beginner Python
  programmers where you can learn to automate common data
  analysis and visualisation tasks</li>
  <li>talks from other scientists and professional software
  engineers on Python in science and best practices for
  developing your own code</li>
  <li>a collaborative <strong>open science sprint</strong>
  where you can bring along a task to automate, or a piece of
  code you want to open source, and we will put you in groups
  to turn your existing scripts or workflow into an
  reproducible piece of open science! Watch this space --
  there may be prizes :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workshops</h2>

<p>While the talks have a common 30 minute format, PyCon UK
Workshops take many varied forms such as a longer 'hands on'
tutorial or a chance for collaboration in a loosely led, group
discussion.</p>

<h3>The PyCon UK Job Fair</h3>
<p>Get recruited by one of our sponsors! Dozens of people have
gotten jobs because of connections made at PyCon UK, although
sometimes in the corridor or socials! Come and meet our
sponsor companies and also meet with fellow Python developers
for tips on the all important Python Job Market.</p>

<h3>Alternative Introduction to Python</h3>
<p>Learn to love the Python Dictionary and then use it to
understand Object Orientation, Modules, the Standard
Library and more.</p>

<h3>Single Board Computer Hackspace</h3>
<p>Time to get tangible and share what you have made with your
Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Beagle Board, re-engineered phone or
other embedded or otherwise interesting hardware project.</p>

<h3>More coming soon</h3>
<p>Many more workshops will be announced in the run up to the
conference. Workshop submissions are still open so please
submit your ideas for workshops you would like to see or even
organise.</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>Obviously it is a bit too early in the conference cycle to
have this year's talks, but they will be shown here as they
  are accepted and entered into the schedule.</p>
<p>Talk submissions are still open, so submit your talk title
and short abstract now!</p>
