<p>If you are a working scientist then this track is for you -- whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista, looking to expand your repertoire. The PyCon UK Science Track will offer you three days of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other scientists using Python.
</p>
<p>The PyCon UK Science Track will feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>tutorials on Python suitable for beginner Python programmers where you can learn to automate common data analysis and visualisation tasks</li>
    <li>talks from other scientists and professional software engineers on Python in science and best practices for developing your own code</li>
    <li>a collaborative <strong>open science sprint</strong> where you can bring along a task to automate, or a piece of code you want to open source, and we will put you in groups to turn your existing scripts or workflow into an reproducible piece of open science!<br/>
    Our friends from <a href="http://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> will be joining us for this, they run a  collaborative cloud service for LaTeX users (think: Google docs for LaTeX) which has a very simple push-to-submit service for a number of Open Access journals and open science services, such as
    <a href="http://f1000research.com/contact">F1000</a>,
    <a href="http://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>,
    <a href="https://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a>,
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> and
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/sdata/">Scientific Data</a>.
    This means that any software or figures you produce on the Monday Sprint can be given a DOI and easily shared with the scientific community.

<h2>Open science</h2>
<p>Why is open science so important to an libre software community like PyCon UK?
