<p>Education is at the heart of the Python community, after
all, Guido van Rossum himself (the inventor of Python) tells
us that Python was created as a language for anyone to use.</p>

<p>For the fourth year in a row, we're organising a set of
activities for learners of all ages, abilities and backgrounds.
The Python community is open to all and we want to support,
cherish and foster our newest members.</p>

<p>We have something for everyone:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#teachers">Teacher training</a></li>
    <li><a href="#kids">Kids coding</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transcode">Trans*Code</a></li>
    <li><a href="#django-girls">Django Girls</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>On Friday</h2>

<h3 id="teachers">Teachers</h3>

<p>We look forward to welcoming our teaching colleagues for a
day of training, collaboration, resource writing and
networking in a friendly yet fun environment where we aim to
help teachers get the most out of Python. </li>

<p>The picture above is from a workshop for both teachers and
developers where we all learned about object oriented
programming.</p>

<p>This year we're welcoming back the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/">Raspberry Pi Foundation education team</a>
and <a href="http://jam-packed.uk">Jam Packed</a> to help us
run the training.</p>

issues facing women and the transgender community

workshops. Participants drawn from all skill levels and
backgrounds are welcome.</p>

<p>Their mission is to bring more amazing women into the world
of technology and increase the diversity of our
community. They believe that technology is for people and
everyone should be able to build it. They make technology more
approachable by creating simple tools and resources designed
with empathy.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<h3 id="kids">Kids' Day</h3>

<p>We will be holding a Raspberry Jam where participants of all
ages will get to play, code, learn and share all things
programming in Python on a RaspberryPi and any other device
we can get to work.</p>

<p>We aim to run various workshops aimed
at young beginner Pythonistas throughout the day. These will
include web design, robotics, Minecraft and physical
computing. Our aim is to turn excited kids into exhausted but
inspired proto-programmers. :-)</p>

<p>The cost is only Â£5 per child and parents/guardians get in
for free. <a href="/register">Book here</a>.</p>
